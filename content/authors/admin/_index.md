Hi there!

I'm currently a PhD Student in Machine Learning at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) where I am currently advised by Prof. [Christopher Rozell](http://siplab.gatech.edu/rozell.html).

My research interests are at the intersection of Machine Learning, Neuroscience and Economics. I am interested in **understanding how humans make decisions**. Currently I am examining how comparison based machine learning can help us understand motivation and cognitive effort.

I finished my Masters in Computer Science, at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), specializing in Machine Learning, where I was advised by Prof. [Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/). I incorporated group information in modelling Healthcare Associated Infections.

Previously, I was an Applied AI Intern at [Netomi](https://www.netomi.com/), an AI for customer service startup, where I was mentored by Dr. [Partho Nath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/partho-nath/). I developed semi-supervised clustering methods for topic discovery in large customer service ticket datasets.

In the Summer of 2020, I was a SURF Intern at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) where I was advised by Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/). We developed energy-aware algorithms to schedule precedence constrained tasks on multiple servers.

I finished my undergraduate studies, double majoring in Computer Science and Biology with a minor in Statistics, at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) where I completed my Honors thesis with Prof. [Daniel Kifer](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~duk17/). For my thesis, I worked on improving the scalability of certifiably adversarial robust deep neural networks.

Other than research, I'm an enthusiastic amateur cricket player 🏏, avid reader 📚, and learn Muay Thai 🥊. 

If you would like to get in contact with me, feel free to reach out via email.
