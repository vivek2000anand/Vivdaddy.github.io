Hi there!

I'm a PhD Student in Machine Learning at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) where I am advised by Prof. [Christopher Rozell](http://siplab.gatech.edu/rozell.html) and Dr. [Sankaraleengam Alagapan](https://www.sankaralagapan.com/).

My research interests are at the intersection of Machine Learning, Neuroscience and Economics. I am interested in **understanding how people make decisions** and how **neurotechnology can be used to improve decision making**. Currently I am working on 1) learning subjective percepts like taste, smell, aesthetics and perceived effort using active learning and representation learning and 2) identifying the neural correlates and dynamics of effort based decision making via stereoelectroencephalography and other modalities like electromyography, pupillometry, eyetracking and heart rate.

I finished my Masters in Computer Science, at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), specializing in Machine Learning, where I was advised by Prof. [Aditya Prakash](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/). I incorporated group information in modelling Healthcare Associated Infections.

Previously, I was an Applied AI Intern at [Netomi](https://www.netomi.com/), an AI for customer service startup, where I was mentored by Dr. [Partho Nath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/partho-nath/). I developed semi-supervised clustering methods for topic discovery in large customer service ticket datasets.

In the Summer of 2020, I was a SURF Intern at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) where I was advised by Prof. [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/). We developed energy-aware algorithms to schedule precedence constrained tasks on multiple servers.

I finished my undergraduate studies, double majoring in Computer Science and Biology with a minor in Statistics, at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/) where I completed my Honors thesis with Prof. [Daniel Kifer](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~duk17/). For my thesis, I worked on improving the scalability of certifiably adversarial robust deep neural networks.

Other than research, I'm an enthusiastic amateur cricket player üèè and an avid reader üìö. 

If you would like to get in contact with me, feel free to reach out via email.
